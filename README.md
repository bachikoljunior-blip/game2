# KAGEROU 陽炎

A mobile-first third-person samurai action game, built in Three.js, with **zero external
assets** — every texture, mesh, animation and sound is synthesised in code at boot.

> Mountain shrine, magic hour, autumn. Draw, deflect, cut.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # → dist/
npm run shots      # build, then capture the visual-review screenshot set
```

## Controls

**Phone (primary target)**

| | |
|---|---|
| left thumb | floating analogue stick — origin snaps to wherever you first touch |
| right thumb, drag | camera |
| right thumb, **flick** | slash in the flick direction (8 directions) |
| right thumb, tap | light attack |
| 受 hold | guard; release at the moment of impact to parry |
| 避 | dodge |
| 技 | special |
| 敵 | lock on |

**Desktop**

`WASD` move · mouse look (right-drag or click to capture) · `LMB` attack · `Shift+LMB` heavy ·
`C` guard · `Space` dodge · `Q` lock on · `E` special · `R` sheathe · `1/2/3` stance ·
`Esc` pause. Gamepads are supported.

## Why it looks the way it does

The whole build is procedural, which sounds like a limitation and is actually the point:
a phone downloads under two megabytes and then spends a few hundred milliseconds
synthesising a world locally, instead of streaming a hundred megabytes of textures it will
sample four times.

- **Materials** are evaluated per pixel from domain-warped simplex and worley fields, with
  normals derived by Sobel from the same height field — not faked from albedo luminance.
- **Terrain** is a ridged multifractal run through a real hydraulic-droplet erosion pass;
  the erosion channels are what stop it reading as noise.
- **Sky** is an analytic atmosphere with a proper sun disc, feeding a PMREM environment map
  that lights everything else.
- **Animation** is a pose-blend graph with 2D locomotion blending, two-bone IK, foot
  planting and Verlet cloth — no baked clips, no imported skeletons.
- **Audio** is synthesised: struck-bar models for the blade clash, Karplus-Strong for the
  koto, a membrane model for the taiko, and a generative score that reacts to the fight.

## Performance

The pass/fail line is **60 fps on a mid-range Android at the MEDIUM tier**. The engine
profiles the GPU at boot, picks a tier, then continuously walks a dynamic render scale up
and down to hold the frame budget (`src/core/Engine.js`, `_adapt`). Add
`?q=low|medium|high|ultra` to the URL to force a tier, `?debug` for the overlay.

| tier | render scale | shadows | post |
|---|---|---|---|
| low | 0.62 | 1 cascade, hard | bloom, grade, grain, sharpen |
| medium | 0.80 | 2 cascades, soft | + SSAO, god rays, chromatic |
| high | 1.00 | 3 cascades, PCSS | + TAA, motion blur, DOF |
| ultra | 1.00 | 4 cascades, PCSS | everything, max taps |

## Layout

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the binding contract: the system interface,
the `ctx` object, the event table, the entity shape, units, art direction and the
per-tier performance budget. Every module follows it.

src/gameplay/ physics, player, camera, combat, enemies
src/fx/       impact effects, weather
src/ui/       hud, touch controls, menus
